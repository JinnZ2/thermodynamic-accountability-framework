success_specification_validator.py

Capstone audit module for transportation_automation_audit.py
and companion modules.

Defines what SUCCESS actually means thermodynamically across
all coupled constraint layers, then measures whether the
system being deployed is aimed at that target or at its
inverse.

Core insight (from a 6M-mile practitioner baseline):

  Success is not "minimize individual vehicle time."
  Success is FLUIDITY across all coupled layers:
    - traffic flow (load-balancing, not shock-wave)
    - infrastructure health (preventive load distribution)
    - human coordination (dock fluidity, cooperation)
    - vehicle longevity (smooth-flow wear thermodynamics)
    - ecological coexistence (alerting wildlife, not startling)
    - schedule integration (zero-stop where possible)
    - exceptional customer service (cooperation at every node)

Measured as TOTAL-SYSTEM energy dissipation minimized and
throughput maximized, NOT as individual-vehicle metrics.

This is mastery-specification, not mastery-comparison.
The bar isn't "match the median driver."
The bar is "operate at the thermodynamic ceiling."

If automation is optimized for individual-vehicle metrics,
it's pointed at the OPPOSITE of success across every coupled
layer. Deployment will produce the inverse of success:
increased friction, infrastructure degradation, human
antagonism, ecological disruption.
