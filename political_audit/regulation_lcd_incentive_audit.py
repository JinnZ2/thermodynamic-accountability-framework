regulation_lcd_incentive_audit.py

Add-on audit module for transportation_automation_audit.py
(also stands alone for any domain).

Detects three coupled structural failure patterns:

  1. LOWEST-COMMON-DENOMINATOR REGULATION
     Rules built around the worst-performing (or most-degraded)
     baseline, then applied universally. Treats regulation as
     science when it's really induced-deficit compensation.
  2. INDUCED-DEFICIT FEEDBACK LOOP
     System creates the condition (bad food, sleep deprivation,
     stress, skill atrophy), regulates against the symptom,
     then uses the regulation as justification for further
     restriction or replacement.
  3. INCENTIVE-STRUCTURE CYCLING
     Same financial / regulatory / lobbying actors recreate the
     same degradation pattern across each new technology
     generation. Tool changes; incentive doesn't. Outcome
     doesn't.

These three couple. LCD regulation requires induced deficit
to justify itself; induced deficit requires the incentive
structure that profits from degradation; the incentive
structure requires regulatory capture to remain unchanged.

Breaking any one breaks the loop.
