## Inverted variables (low = good)

These register backwards from the usual "higher is better" direction. Watch the sign when composing scores.

- `ai_capture_risk`
- `hidden_count`
- `mobility_disruption`
- `power_concentration`
- `practice_attachment`
- `rotation_gaming`
- `witness_dependence` (high = skill only appears under observation = fragile)
