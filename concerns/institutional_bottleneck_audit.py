concerns/institutional_bottleneck_audit.py

Audits the Hormuz -> Famine cascade for the LOAD-BEARING failure node.

Finding: the bottleneck is NOT physical (N supply, calendar, biology).
         The bottleneck is REGULATORY -- institutional prohibitions on
         humanure / closed-loop N cycling that force populations onto
         the Haber-Bosch path even when that path is broken.

This module produces an accountability trail:
  - identifies each institutional choke point
  - quantifies lives at risk per month of delay
  - names the deciding authority
  - documents what "we couldn't have known" defenses fail against

If deaths occur after this analysis is public, the deaths are
attributable to institutional configuration, not supply shock.

Sixth module in concerns/. Sharpens the prior two cascade modules
(hormuz_cascade_audit, leverage_analysis_v2) with a structural
finding: the cascade has redundancy in the physical layer (human N
excretion ~32 Mt/yr is the same order of magnitude as Hormuz-
disrupted N supply ~33 Mt/yr), but the redundancy is regulatorily
blocked. The deaths are not from the physical event; they are from
a graph topology that institutions configured and retain authority
over.
