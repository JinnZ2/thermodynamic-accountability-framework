resilience_stack.py

Coupled three-layer resilience architecture for detecting failure modes
in systems that optimize over incomplete or documentation-biased models.

LAYER 1: AbsenceSignatures
Marks the shape of knowledge holes in any system model.
Falsifiable parameters for what is NOT in training data.

LAYER 2: ConstraintNavigator
Models problem-solving as bounded-safety constraint-space navigation.
The grammar of substrate-first thinking, made legible.

LAYER 3: RegulatoryScopeAudit
Audits rules/laws/certifications for scope, parameters, expiration.
Flags unbounded regulations as fraud/gatekeeping vectors.

Coupling: Layer 1 identifies what the system cannot see.
Layer 2 shows how bounded-competence navigates those gaps.
Layer 3 shows how unbounded rules weaponize the same gaps.
