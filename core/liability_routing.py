CC0 / stdlib-only / phone-buildable
Structural-failure audit companion. NOT a thermodynamic proof.

WHAT THIS IS
============
A resource-flow ledger for cosigned-obligation systems (student loans the
paradigm case). It answers one structural question:

    When a cosigned obligation defaults, does LIABILITY route to the node
    whose economic value INCREASED (the beneficiary), or to the node that
    merely carried the SIGNATURE (the guarantor)?

If liability routes to the signature rather than the benefit, the system
has a BENEFIT-LIABILITY MISMATCH. This is not a moral claim; it is a
routing fact you can read off measured flows.

WHY IT EXISTS
=============
Two structural failures the standard "human capital" ledger cannot see:

  1. RESOURCE DESTRUCTION (not redistribution). A cosigner's guaranteeing
     capacity is a finite, SHARED resource across all their dependents.
     A single default does not move that capacity to a higher-capacity
     node -- it ERASES it. The signer can now cosign for NO ONE.

  2. CASCADE. Because the capacity is shared, one default blocks EVERY
     downstream node the signer could have guaranteed -- other children,
     grandchildren, the signer's own further education. N nodes fail from
     one breach. Standard node-by-node output models read the blocked
     nodes as "low capacity" when they are "denied access."

DESIGN CONSTRAINTS (from the JinnZ2 ecosystem)
  - No moral labels in data structures. "beneficiary" / "guarantor" are
    ROLES read from flows, not judgments.
  - No infill of unknowns. Missing measurement -> field stays "unknown"
    and the audit REFUSES a routing verdict (returns NEEDS_DATA).
  - Counterfactuals are flagged ESTIMATE_DEPENDENT, never presented as
    measured.
  - Output is a trajectory + a falsifiable claim, never a stored verdict.
  - Precision honesty: no 3-sig-fig figures manufactured from assumptions.
    Ratios round to 2 places and carry their input provenance.
