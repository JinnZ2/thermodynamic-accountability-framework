"""
banking_thermodynamic_audit.py

Audit of the energy cost of the capital and banking infrastructure
that funds and services oil-extraction and other industrial projects.

Standard EROI calculations treat capital as free. It is not. Banking
infrastructure consumes real energy: data centers, branches, staff,
regulatory and compliance overhead, security, redundancy, currency
creation, debt-servicing computation, risk management apparatus.

This module estimates that cost, attributes it to specific loans,
runs the systemic constraint (banking requires growth; energy is
contracting), and compares the capital-infrastructure cost of
extraction-funded vs. voluntary-labor systems.

Numbers are order-of-magnitude with sources stated. The point is to
expose the structure and let anyone replace the inputs with their
own data. CC0. Standard library only.
