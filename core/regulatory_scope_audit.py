regulatory_scope_audit.py

Audit regulations against their declared scope. Surface when a rule
is being applied outside the conditions it was designed for, so
communities can respond to actual constraints without violating the
regulation's original good-faith intent.

## Premise

Every regulation was written for a specific operating envelope --
a thermal range, a population density, a substrate stability, an
infrastructure assumption. When real conditions exit that envelope,
the regulation is *outside its scope*. Continuing to enforce it
inverts its original purpose and produces the harm it was meant
to prevent.

## The framework

For each regulation, record:
  - its first-principle intent (what harm it was meant to prevent)
  - its declared or inferred scope (when those conditions hold)
  - the current actual conditions

If actual conditions are outside scope, the regulation is flagged
as expired *for that situation*. The intent is preserved; the
specific rule is suspended pending an updated rule that addresses
the new conditions.

This protects communities legally and ethically: they are honoring
the regulation's first-principle intent while exiting its expired
letter. Central authority retains the audit role -- it validates
afterward whether the local response served the intent. If yes,
the action stands. If no, central authority must produce a better
rule that fits the new conditions.

## Linkage

Pairs with simulations/biological_response_infrastructure.py (local
autonomous response) and metrology/constraint_filter_architecture.py
(premise filtering). Sister to core/regulation_cascade_mapper.py
(thermodynamic consequence mapping) and core/timing_as_constraint.py
(TemporalAudit for codes lacking scope/cycles). The scope-audit is
the legal-epistemic instrument that lets the biological mode operate
without being blocked by expired permission regimes.
