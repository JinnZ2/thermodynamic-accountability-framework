audit_authority_scope.py

Audit-authority is itself scope-conditional. Higher tiers of government
get first right to audit a community's crisis response only within their
declared resource and time scope. If they cannot or will not exercise
that right within the declared window, the audit at the next tier down
becomes final.

## Premise

Authority without demonstrated capacity to exercise it is coercion
masquerading as governance. The same scope-audit logic applied to
regulations and corporate charters applies to *audit authority itself*.
A state government that claims final-audit authority over community
crisis response, but cannot resource the audit within 90 days, has
exited the scope of that claim. The community audit becomes the legal
record. A federal authority can override the state audit only by
exercising its own audit within its own scope window -- typically
larger, e.g. 180 days.

This protects both directions:

  - communities don't sit in legal limbo indefinitely while higher
    authorities investigate without resourcing the investigation
  - higher authorities don't get to claim legitimacy through delay
    or resource starvation; they must actually exercise audit
    capacity to retain audit authority
  - documentation rigor at the community level matters because that
    documentation may stand as the final legal record

## Linkage

Extends core/regulatory_scope_audit.py and
core/corporate_charter_scope_audit.py. The community audit records
produced by those modules feed into this tiered review structure.
The five core/ scope-audit modules now form a closed family:
regulation_cascade_mapper (spatial consequence), timing_as_constraint
(temporal scope), regulatory_scope_audit (regulatory operational),
corporate_charter_scope_audit (corporate charter), and this module
(audit authority itself).
