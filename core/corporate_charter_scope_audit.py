"""
corporate_charter_scope_audit.py

Audit corporate operating privileges as scope-conditional. Any
corporation operating within a community holds an implicit charter:
extract value from this market, stabilize with this community when
crisis arrives. Failure to respond within a declared response
threshold (default 24 hours) suspends operating privileges and
activates community asset-access contingency until response is
delivered.

## Premise

A corporate charter is not a permanent grant. It is a conditional
permission to operate inside a community's territory, granted in
exchange for serving community function. When the corporation
exits the scope of that function -- most clearly during a crisis
the corporation refuses to respond to -- the charter is in scope
exit. The community's claim on the corporation's locally held
resources supersedes the corporation's disposal logic for the
duration of the crisis, subject to post-hoc audit.

This is not seizure. It is enforcement of the actual terms of
operating inside the community.

## Linkage

Builds on:
  - core/regulatory_scope_audit.py
      (scope-exit framework for legacy regulations)
  - simulations/biological_response_infrastructure.py
      (local autonomous response under shock)
  - metrology/institutional_audit.py
      (premise filtering across institutional models)

Corporate charters are filtered the same way regulations are;
corporations carrying 'permanence', 'appearance_over_audit',
'performance_over_function' without compensating accountability
cycles are pre-existing scope exits whose crisis-response failure
is predictable.
