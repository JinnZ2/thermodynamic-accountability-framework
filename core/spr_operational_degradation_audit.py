"""
spr_operational_degradation_audit.py

Audit of Strategic Petroleum Reserve infrastructure use against
its design envelope. The SPR salt-cavern infrastructure was
designed for large, sustained drawdown events (e.g., major supply
disruption). Current use is closer to sustained low-rate exchange
operations: continuous small releases via swap agreements, no
refilling, extended timelines.

This module:
    1. Records design-spec operating envelope.
    2. Records observed use pattern (2022-2026).
    3. Audits the mismatch between design use and actual use.
    4. Estimates operational degradation as a function of cycling
       frequency under non-designed conditions.
    5. Flags when the reserve has crossed operational thresholds
       even if volume remains.

Numbers are order-of-magnitude with public-source basis. The point
is to expose the structure of the audit so anyone can run it with
better data.
