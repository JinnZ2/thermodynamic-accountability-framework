driver_hours_evidence_register.py  --  CC0 1.0, stdlib only

What this is: a register of what is KNOWN, what is only SELF-REPORTED,
and what is UNMEASURED about long driving days, fatigue, and driver
tenure. Built 2026-09-23 from a search pass. Gaps are the product.

Status scale (one scale for every source, including the operator's own
record):
  OBSERVED    read directly off a primary source, or first-hand record
  SECONDARY   relayed by a secondary source; primary not read
  DERIVED     follows from two or more entries
  PROPOSED    offered for test
  UNMEASURED  no source found that measures it
  UNREAD      source located, content relevant, full text not read
  EXPLORATION real gap, relevance to the question UNKNOWN; kept, not
              load-bearing

Sampling-frame flags (every source carries one):
  ON_ROAD      interviewed while working -> excludes drivers already out
               (crashed, quit, fired): survivorship
  ADMISSION    self-report where admitting it carried risk
               (inspection station) -> likely UNDERcount of hours
  VENDOR       party reporting benefits from the number
  N_OF_1       single first-hand record
  ARCHIVE      narrative / oral history, not a sample
  TERM_DRIFT   item wording carries two meanings across populations;
               the count mixes them (see TERM NOTES)

Nothing here is a finding about any individual. It is a map of which
questions the record can and cannot answer yet.
