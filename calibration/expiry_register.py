"""expiry_register.py -- every PENDING / UNKNOWN in this repo, classified, with an
expiry condition where one applies. CC0, stdlib only.

Work order 2026-11-10 (cross-model audit follow-up), item 1(b), confirmed by the
operator 2026-11-11. Source of the confound: Kimi audit C7 (unfalsifiability
drift): "every UNKNOWN must carry an expiry condition (an instrument class,
sensitivity, and protocol whose null result would downgrade the entry to
'absent-at-this-sensitivity')".

The counted base. "43 PENDING + 36 UNKNOWN" reproduces on this tree as
    PENDING  = lines containing the string PENDING       (grep -rn PENDING)      43
    UNKNOWN  = lines containing the WORD UNKNOWN          (grep -rnw UNKNOWN)     36
The two counts use different rules (PENDING has 45 occurrences on 43 lines;
UNKNOWN has 43 lines as a substring, 36 as a word). The rule each count used is
this session's reconstruction from the numbers, not a stated rule; recorded.

A count of a token is not a count of slots. Each occurrence gets one class:

    SLOT      a value held open in a record or ledger (a quantity not yet measured)
    EMITTER   code that returns the token under a condition the code states
    DEFAULT   an initial value a run overwrites
    VOCAB     a definition of the token: enum member, sentinel, rank map, counter
    RULE      prose stating the rule that a slot is held open
    MENTION   prose or a comment pointing at a slot or emitter registered elsewhere
    ARCHIVE   an archived copy of prose (README archive)
    OTHER_SENSE  the token used for something else (an unrecognised tag)

Only SLOT, EMITTER and DEFAULT carry expiry_condition. It is the string "void"
(no exit defined) or a dict with instrument_class, sensitivity, protocol,
provenance. sensitivity may be "void" (exit incomplete). Nothing fails on a
missing exit; the count is reported (work order: "flag as 'no exit defined';
report, do not fail").

ABSENT_AT_SENSITIVITY(<value>) is the state a slot moves to when its exit
instrument runs at a stated sensitivity and returns null. It is a scoped
absence, never a bare "absent". No slot in this repo is in that state today;
the count is printed as a visible zero.

Delivered files are not edited (docs/DCEA_v0.1.md and the road-driver ledger
are sha-pinned in docs/DCEA_checks.md). Exits live here, beside them.
