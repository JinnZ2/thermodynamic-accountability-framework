information_cost_audit.py

Why false certainty is expensive -- not just thermodynamically,
but informationally.

Companion module to study_scope_audit.py. Where study_scope_audit
provides the MACHINERY for auditing a cited study (instrument,
protocol, regime, scope), this module provides the JUSTIFICATION:
an information-theoretic account of why models that commit to
false closure accumulate exponential cost, and why scope-bounded
uncertainty stays linear.

The worked example is geocentrism. Each anomaly (retrograde motion,
Venus phases, stellar parallax, Jupiter moons) required an epicycle,
a denial, or an unfalsifiable claim to preserve the central false
commitment. Those costs are accounted for here as module-level data.

The moral for AI systems: a confident closed answer FEELS low-cost
because the near-term cost is low. The actual cost is the epicycle
load it will accumulate when the measurement frontier advances --
and that frontier always advances.
