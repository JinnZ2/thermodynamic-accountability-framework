adaptation_debt.py — friction removal as stored fragility liability

Source: Calibration Diagnostic Q5, Independent Animal's Creed I (2026).
License: CC0.
Dependencies: stdlib only.

Core model (falsifiable):
When friction is removed from a system, the adaptation it produced stops
occurring. The absence compounds over time.
debt(t) = Σᵢ initial_load_i × (1 + rᵢ)^tᵢ

where:
    initial_load_i = severity of removed friction event
    rᵢ             = compounding rate (domain-specific)
    tᵢ             = years since removal

This mirrors infrastructure-stability-model's latent-node time constants:
maintenance debt accumulates at a rate the system does not measure until
failure.
