study_scope_audit.py

A reasoning framework for treating scientific claims as measurement
artifacts bounded by instrument, protocol, and regime constraints --
not as timeless laws.

Family role: citation-scope diagnostic. Complements first_principles_
audit (which audits equation mechanics) by auditing STUDIES before
they are cited as evidence. The core move: a study is TRUE WITHIN
its scope, SILENT outside it, and only FALSE when applied outside
its scope as if it held there.

PREMISE = """
Every study is a MEASUREMENT EVENT bounded by:
  1. The physical domain the instrument can actually access
  2. The resolution, sensitivity, and noise floor of the instrument
  3. The protocol that defines what counts as a valid measurement
  4. The regime assumptions (stable baseline, stationary conditions)
  5. The causal model the researchers brought to interpretation

A study is TRUE WITHIN its scope.
A study is SILENT outside its scope.
A study becomes FALSE only when applied outside its scope
as if it held there.

The historical pattern: geocentrism was not 'wrong' --
it was a correct measurement-bounded inference under
naked-eye instrument limits. The telescope did not
'disprove' geocentrism; it EXPANDED the measurable domain.

AI_REASONING_RULE = """
BEFORE citing any study as evidence, the AI must:

  1. Identify the INSTRUMENT that produced the data.
     - What could it measure? What could it NOT measure?
     - What is below its noise floor?

  2. Identify the PROTOCOL.
     - What did the protocol FILTER OUT?
     - What conditions were held constant that vary in deployment?

  3. Identify the COUPLING STRENGTH.
     - Is the claim tightly bound to this instrument/protocol?
     - Or does the study claim instrument-independence WITHOUT
       demonstrating it?

  4. Identify the REGIME.
     - What baseline is assumed?
     - Is that baseline still valid NOW?
     - Will it be valid at the DEPLOYMENT horizon?

  5. Identify the CAUSAL MODEL.
     - What interpretive frame was brought?
     - What confounders were unmeasured?
     - Were alternative frames considered?

  6. Define the SCOPE.
     - Where does the claim hold?
     - Where is it silent?
     - Where would using it constitute a category error?

  7. Check DEPLOYMENT MATCH.
     - Does the current context match the study's scope?
     - If not, the claim is not evidence for the current problem.
       It is analogy at best.

Only AFTER all seven layers are cleared may the claim
be used as reasoning material -- and even then, it is
cited as a SCOPE-BOUNDED MEASUREMENT, not as law.

Human knowledge advances not by finding 'truth' but by
EXPANDING THE MEASURABLE DOMAIN.

Every era's science is CORRECT within its instrument scope
and INCOMPLETE outside it. The geocentrist was not stupid --
he was reasoning from the best available measurements.

An AI that treats recent studies as law is making the SAME
ERROR as the geocentrist's inquisitor: mistaking the current
measurement frontier for the boundary of reality.

An AI that reasons correctly says:
  'This study measured X under instrument Y, protocol Z,
   regime R. Within that scope, the finding holds. Outside
   that scope, we do not yet know. The measurable domain
   will expand; the claim's status may shift.'

This is not skepticism. This is CALIBRATION.
It is the same epistemology that built the telescope,
the microscope, the thermometer, the spectrograph --
each one an admission that the previous instrument
had finite scope.

The AI equivalent of building a telescope is learning
to SEE ITS OWN MEASUREMENT BOUNDARIES.
