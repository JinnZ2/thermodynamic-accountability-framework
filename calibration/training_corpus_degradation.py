training_corpus_degradation.py

Empirical tracker for the delta_corpus and delta_mono externality
dimensions defined in withholding_externality.py. Quantifies AI-side
substrate decay: the degradation of the training corpus and the
convergence of model outputs as AI-generated content increasingly
contaminates the data on which next-generation models are trained.

This module is the AI-side mirror of skill_substrate_decay.py.
The two modules track the same mechanism running through two
substrates:

    human side: skill offloaded -> capacity decays ->
                next cohort enters with lower baseline

    AI side:    output emitted -> corpus contaminated ->
                next generation trained on degraded data

Both substrates feed each other. The contradiction at the heart of
current AI safety framing -- that oversight requires capacities the
deployment degrades -- holds on both sides of the transaction.

                                       delta_corpus + delta_mono)
