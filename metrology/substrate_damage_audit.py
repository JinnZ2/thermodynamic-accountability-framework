substrate_damage_audit.py

Audit module flagging when behavioral, psychological, and collapse-prediction
models are built on populations exhibiting institutional substrate damage
rather than baseline human capacity.

Core metrology problem:
Most "human nature" and "collapse behavior" models train on populations
several generations into accumulated institutional stress (chronic racism,
patriarchy, socioeconomic hierarchy, ecological disconnection). Measured
fragility is misread as biological universal. Resulting predictions then
justify policies that deepen the damage, closing a self-validating loop.

This module encodes the cascade as falsifiable claims with detection signals,
scoring dimensions, and a scope-audit gate. CC0. Standard library only.

  - metrology/constraint_filter_architecture.py
      (sort models by failure signature)
  - metrology/institutional_audit.py
