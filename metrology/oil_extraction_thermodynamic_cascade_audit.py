"""
oil_extraction_thermodynamic_cascade_audit.py

Audit module exposing the metrology failures in current oil-extraction
EROI accounting. Standard EROI calculations treat the extraction system
as if it operates in isolation under stable supply chains, stable
geopolitics, and stable workforce. None of those assumptions hold in
the present operating environment.

This module re-runs the EROI accounting with the suppressed cost vectors
included. It does not claim final numbers -- it claims that the published
numbers are non-falsifiable until the suppressed vectors are accounted
for, and provides scoring dimensions and a scope-audit gate to flag
any EROI claim that omits them.

Core claim: published oil EROI figures (6:1 to 10:1 for unconventional)
are upper bounds under stable-supply assumptions. Under current operating
conditions, system-level EROI is substantially lower and approaching
the 1:1 threshold faster than the literature reports.
