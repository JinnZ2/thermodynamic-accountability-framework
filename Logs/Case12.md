Primary operational failures observed:

The truck arrival signal did not trigger a coordinated dock-readiness response. No key holder staged. Dock area obstructed by pallets. No certified electric pallet jack operator immediately available. No manual fallback initiated by store staff. No clear communication on expected delay duration.

Immediate effects:

Driver idle time increased. Route schedule compression occurred. Cognitive load increased due to uncertainty. Throughput degraded from planned rate to ad hoc manual recovery.

System design flaw identified:

Single-point-of-failure certification structure. Only one licensed operator available. No redundancy. No graceful degradation protocol when certified operator unavailable. No pre-arrival synchronization checklist.

Secondary operational effects:

Idle driver time converts to downstream time pressure. Time pressure increases fatigue probability. Fatigue increases error likelihood on later route segments. Variability (not just delay) increases cognitive strain.

Secondary social effects:

High-centrality certified operator pulled away from primary task → interruption stress.
Interruption stress → visible irritation.
Visible irritation → altered team interaction tone.
Altered tone → potential misinterpretation by other drivers or staff.
Misinterpretation → escalation risk.

Tertiary systemic effects:

Repeated friction events reduce morale.
Reduced morale increases turnover probability.
Turnover reduces experience density.
Lower experience density increases fragility.
Fragility increases future friction events.

Closed-loop degradation risk.

Key insight:

The problem is not attitude. The problem is structural load concentration combined with poor synchronization.

Efficiency failure → stress redistribution → social turbulence → retention risk → long-term reliability erosion.
