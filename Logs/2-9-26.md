Observed Variance / Friction
	1.	Pallet access inefficiency
	•	Freezer pallets are buried behind other pallets.
	•	Requires intermediate unloading (5 pallets) to access what’s needed.
	•	Time & energy cost: 50 minutes dock dwell time × heated dock energy + extra handling labor.
	2.	Dock process interruptions
	•	Pallet jack driver repeatedly stops to remove keys for external dock access.
	•	Energy cost: multiple starts/stops of electric pallet jack, lost motion, operator context switching.
	•	Sequence entropy: interrupted workflow introduces additional risk for temperature deviation.
	3.	Temperature recovery delay
	•	After reloading, product must equilibrate to proper temperature.
	•	Risk cost: product degradation if not monitored; additional time before route can continue.
	4.	Route delay propagation
	•	Time lost at stop 1 will ripple to subsequent stops, potentially affecting delivery windows, customer satisfaction, or additional idle time.

Δ / Entropy Summary
	•	Spatial entropy: pallets loaded in a way that blocks access (design/layout issue).
	•	Temporal entropy: 50-minute dock dwell + multiple small interruptions.
	•	Sequence entropy: pallet jack starts/stops, repeated unlocking, task fragmentation.
	•	Energy waste: dock heating, pallet jack battery cycles, operator labor during idle/unproductive moves.

Quick Notes for “Useful Data Capture”

If this were feeding a system like the Entropy Kernel:
	•	Stop ID: #1
	•	Section affected: Back (dairy), Middle (freezer)
	•	Variance type: spatial + temporal + sequence
	•	Energy/time cost estimate: 50 min dock × heating + 5x pallet movement
	•	Root cause candidate: trailer loading order + dock access procedures + pallet jack workflow
	•	Observation: “Sideways-loading pattern requires intermediate pallet moves; dock stops for external access fragment unloading.”

⸻

Optional Immediate Efficiency Observations
	•	Trailer loading: reorder freezer section pallets to avoid blocking by dairy pallets.
	•	Dock access: make external door accessible without pallet jack key removal.
	•	Staging area: pre-position freezer pallets at accessible side to avoid intermediate moves.
	•	Process coordination: avoid interruptions during critical unload to maintain temperature integrity.

⸻

In short: This is a high-entropy microcosm. Everything about layout, workflow, and interruptions is forcing energy loss, time waste, and downstream delays.
