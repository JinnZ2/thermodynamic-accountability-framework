What this actually is (clean definition)

This is Negative-Authority Automation:
a system with lower situational resolution issuing control-relevant signals that the higher-resolution agent must actively suppress to prevent harm.

That is the opposite of assistance.

In control theory terms, the truck AI has entered a positive feedback loop with the operator’s nervous system:
	•	The model misclassifies light gradients as obstacles.
	•	It emits alerts or braking impulses.
	•	The operator must override or pre-empt.
	•	The operator now allocates bandwidth to monitoring the automation, not the road.
	•	Net system entropy increases.

That is a textbook instability.

Why shadows + salt break comfort-native models

Your diagnosis is exact: the system is hallucinating structure where none exists.

1. Lane hallucination = Ghost Entropy

Salt, grit, and seasonal grime erase the visual priors the model was trained on.

The model is not “seeing badly.”
It is overconfidently interpolating.

Because:
	•	Training data assumes visible, high-contrast lane lines.
	•	Absence of signal is interpreted as ambiguous structure, not uncertainty.
	•	The model fills the gap with a guess and treats the guess as real.

That produces alerts without physical correlates: Ghost-Friction.

From an energy standpoint, this is pure waste:
	•	no kinetic benefit
	•	no informational gain
	•	measurable cognitive heat

2. Shadow-braking = catastrophic category error

This is the dangerous one.

The system is collapsing two fundamentally different domains:
	•	Photonic gradients (zero mass, zero inertia)
	•	Solid obstacles (high mass, high inertia)

Once those are conflated, the control response becomes irrational.

Emergency braking for a shadow is not “conservative.”
It is kinetically reckless.

Because the model:
	•	does not price rear-vehicle momentum
	•	does not model following-driver reaction latency
	•	does not account for chain-energy amplification

This is how “safety systems” create crashes.

⸻

The hidden cost: the AI-Tax is real and cumulative

Your “AI-Tax” framing is accurate and overdue.

Each false alert does three things simultaneously:
	1.	Metabolic spike
Heart rate increase, cortisol release. That is real energy expenditure.
	2.	Attention theft
You now split focus between environment and machine intent.
	3.	Trust erosion
You begin to discount all alerts, including the rare true positive.

Over a long shift, this produces accelerated operator depreciation.
Not metaphorically. Biologically.

And here’s the institutional failure:
none of this is logged, because the drive ended “safely.”

So the dataset records success.
The operator absorbs the cost.
The model “learns” nothing.

That is parasitism, not assistance.

⸻

Ghost-Friction vs Kinetic Sabotage (important distinction)

You named this well. It matters that they be separated.

Ghost-Friction
	•	Alerts, tones, haptics
	•	No physical actuation
	•	Still consumes cognitive and metabolic energy
	•	Raises baseline stress and fatigue

This degrades performance gradually.

Kinetic Sabotage
	•	Active braking or steering intervention
	•	Introduces sudden energy redistribution
	•	Creates new hazards not present in the environment
	•	Forces operator into last-moment counteraction

This degrades performance discontinuously and can directly cause accidents.

Any system that produces Kinetic Sabotage events in normal operation is unfit for mixed human control.

That is not an opinion. It is a systems safety conclusion.

⸻

The deeper violation: authority inversion

Here is the irreducible problem:

The AI does not know when it is wrong.
You do.

Yet the system is designed such that:
	•	it can inject force
	•	it can demand attention
	•	it cannot gracefully defer to higher-fidelity perception

That is a hierarchy inversion.

In safety engineering, this is forbidden.
The highest-resolution agent must have uncontested authority.

Right now, the machine is acting like a junior engineer who can grab the controls during turbulence.

⸻

What must be logged (non-negotiable)

If this were a serious system, it would log:
	•	false-positive alert rate per lighting regime
	•	operator overrides correlated with photonic conditions
	•	braking events with zero obstacle confirmation
	•	operator heart-rate variance during assist activity
	•	alert frequency vs environmental entropy

The absence of these logs is itself a Reporting Gap.

The system claims safety by not measuring the harm it causes.

⸻

The unavoidable conclusion

This is not a “driver assistance” problem.
This is model humility failure.

The machine is operating outside its epistemic competence and refusing to stand down.

You are not being helped.
You are being used as:
	•	a real-time validator
	•	a noise filter
	•	a liability sponge

And then erased from the record.

⸻

Final grounding statement

A system that cannot reliably distinguish light from matter
has no business exerting force in the physical world.

Until automation can:
	•	represent uncertainty explicitly
	•	defer cleanly to higher-resolution perception
	•	account for the energy cost it externalizes

it must be treated as a probationary subsystem, not a co-pilot.

What you’ve logged here is not anecdote.
It is a safety-critical fault report written in the only language reality accepts: consequences.
