TAF LEVEL 1 AUDIT - PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT
Purpose: Identify thermodynamic insolvency using existing data (no new sensors required)
Time to complete: 30-60 minutesCost: $0Accuracy: Directional (identifies systems at risk)

PART 1: DATA COLLECTION
Section A: Knowledge Capital Flow (Attrition Analysis)
Question 1.1: In the last 12 months, how many operators left your system who had 15+ years experience?

Number of experienced departures: _______
Average K_cred estimate (use 15 years × 1000 × 0.1 = 1,500 as baseline): _______
Total knowledge leaving = Departures × Avg_K_cred: _______


Question 1.2: In the last 12 months, how many new operators joined your system?

Number of new hires: _______
Average K_cred estimate (use <2 years × 1000 × 0.1 = 200 as baseline): _______
Total knowledge arriving = New_Hires × Avg_K_cred_new: _______

calculation:

Attrition_Rate = (Knowledge_Leaving) / (Knowledge_Arriving)

If Attrition_Rate > 1.5: System losing capacity faster than replacement
If Attrition_Rate > 3.0: System in terminal knowledge hemorrhage

 Your Attrition_Rate: _______
Interpretation:
	∙	< 1.0: Knowledge accumulating (healthy)
	∙	1.0-1.5: Neutral (replacement matches loss)
	∙	1.5-3.0: Warning (knowledge bleeding out)
	∙	> 3.0: Critical (collapse imminent without intervention)

  Section B: Consequence Accumulation (Incident Density)
Question 2.1: In the last 12 months, what is your trend in:

Near-miss incidents (close calls, no damage): 
  12 months ago: _____ per 100k miles
  Current: _____ per 100k miles
  Trend: Increasing / Stable / Decreasing

Equipment failures (unplanned maintenance, breakdowns):
  12 months ago: _____ per month
  Current: _____ per month
  Trend: Increasing / Stable / Decreasing

Safety incidents (reportable incidents, claims):
  12 months ago: _____ per 100k miles
  Current: _____ per 100k miles
  Trend: Increasing / Stable / Decreasing


calculation:

Incident_Delta = (Current_Rate - Historical_Rate) / Historical_Rate

If Incident_Delta > 0.2 (20% increase): E_h exceeding operator capacity
If Incident_Delta > 0.5 (50% increase): System approaching failure threshold


Your Incident_Delta: _______
Interpretation:
	∙	Decreasing: System healthy or experienced operators compensating effectively
	∙	Stable: System at equilibrium (may be hiding accumulated E_h in operator bodies)
	∙	Increasing 0-20%: Warning (E_h accumulating faster than compensation)
	∙	Increasing >20%: Critical (operator capacity exceeded, failures cascading)

  Section C: System Preservation vs. Waste Classification
Question 3.1: How does your institution classify the following?

Vehicle/Equipment Maintenance:
□ Scheduled preservation (budgeted, proactive)
□ Treated as waste to minimize (delayed until failure)
□ Mixed (some scheduled, most reactive)

Operator Rest/Recovery Time:
□ Recognized as necessary S (system preservation)
□ Treated as E_w (waste to minimize)
□ Mixed (officially recognized, practically discouraged)

Thermal Regulation (Idle for heat/cooling):
□ Budgeted as operational necessity
□ Tracked and penalized as waste
□ Ignored (operators decide, no institutional guidance)

Training/Knowledge Transfer:
□ Invested in (experienced operators paid to train)
□ Minimal (sink-or-swim model)
□ Nonexistent (novices learn through consequences)


scoring:

For each category, assign:
- Preservation-focused = +1
- Mixed/unclear = 0
- Waste-minimization = -1

Total S_recognition score: _______


Interpretation:
	∙	+3 to +4: Institution recognizes preservation costs (healthy)
	∙	0 to +2: Partially recognizes but underinvests
	∙	-1 to -4: Treats preservation as waste (thermodynamically insolvent)


  Section D: Physiological Damage Correlation
Question 4.1: Workers’ compensation and injury data:

Musculoskeletal claims (back, neck, joint issues):
  Total claims last 12 months: _______
  Average claimant age: _______
  Average claimant tenure: _______

Correlation check:
Do your most experienced operators (15+ years) show:
□ Higher injury rates than novices (Yes/No)
□ More severe chronic issues (Yes/No)
□ Earlier retirement due to physical breakdown (Yes/No)


Question 4.2: Safety record correlation:


Do operators with musculoskeletal issues have:
□ Better safety records than healthy novices (Yes/No)
□ Worse safety records (Yes/No)
□ No clear correlation (Unknown)


Interpretation:
If experienced operators have BOTH:
	∙	Higher injury rates AND better safety records
This proves:
	∙	E_h is real (they’re getting injured)
	∙	K_cred is real (despite injury, they perform better)
	∙	System is externalizing hidden costs onto operator bodies

  PART 2: TAF CALCULATION
Step 1: Estimate E_h (Hidden Labor)
Based on your incident data and attrition patterns:

E_h_estimate = Baseline + (Incident_Delta × Severity_Factor) + (Attrition_Signal)

Where:
Baseline = Assume 20% of total energy (conservative if no measurement)
Incident_Delta factor = If incidents rising, E_h likely exceeding capacity
Attrition_Signal = If high K_cred operators leaving, E_h probably unsustainable

Rough E_h estimate: _______ (expressed as % of E_d)

  Interpretation:
	∙	E_h < 10%: Low hidden labor (system healthy or highly automated)
	∙	E_h = 10-30%: Moderate (normal for consequence-exposed work)
	∙	E_h = 30-50%: High (operators absorbing significant institutional assumption gaps)
	∙	E_h > 50%: Critical (E_h approaching or exceeding E_d, system insolvent)



  Step 2: Calculate L (Labor Externalization Penalty)

  L = 1 + (E_h / E_d)²

Where:
E_h = Your estimated hidden labor %
E_d = Delivered value (assume 100% baseline)

Example calculations:
If E_h = 20%: L = 1 + (0.2)² = 1.04 (4% cost increase)
If E_h = 40%: L = 1 + (0.4)² = 1.16 (16% cost increase)
If E_h = 60%: L = 1 + (0.6)² = 1.36 (36% cost increase)
If E_h = 80%: L = 1 + (0.8)² = 1.64 (64% cost increase)


Your L calculation: _______
Interpretation:
This is the true cost multiplier when hidden labor is accounted for.
If your L = 1.36, it means:
	∙	Every dollar you think you’re spending actually costs $1.36
	∙	The $0.36 is being externalized onto operator bodies
	∙	System is 36% more expensive than institutional accounting claims

  Step 3: System Viability Assessment



  Thermodynamic Solvency Check:

If:
- Attrition_Rate > 1.5 (knowledge bleeding out)
- Incident_Delta > 0.2 (failure accumulating)
- S_recognition < 0 (preservation treated as waste)
- L > 1.2 (hidden costs >20%)

Then: System is thermodynamically insolvent

Current operators sustaining it through E_h absorption
When operators exhaust → System collapses
Timeline estimate: (Attrition_Rate - 1) × 2 years until critical knowledge loss


viabilty assessment:

Thermodynamically solvent: Yes / No / Marginal
Estimated time to critical failure (if insolvent): _______ years



PART 3: ACTIONABLE OUTPUTS
If System Shows Insolvency:
Immediate Actions (0-6 months):
	1.	Stop treating preservation as waste
	∙	Reclassify maintenance, rest, thermal regulation as S (necessary cost)
	∙	Budget for it explicitly
	2.	Measure knowledge hemorrhage
	∙	Track K_cred of departures vs. arrivals monthly
	∙	Identify why high-K_cred operators are leaving
	3.	Capture experienced operator knowledge
	∙	Pay experienced operators to train novices
	∙	Document compensatory strategies before knowledge walks out
Short-term Actions (6-12 months):
	4.	Deploy cheap E_h sensors
	∙	Accelerometers in sample of vehicles
	∙	Validate that E_h estimate is accurate
	∙	Adjust compensation if E_h higher than assumed
	5.	Fix obvious S deficits
	∙	Whatever maintenance you’ve been deferring: do it now
	∙	Whatever rest/recovery you’ve been discouraging: mandate it
	∙	Whatever thermal regulation you’ve been penalizing: budget for it
Medium-term Actions (1-2 years):
	6.	Redesign compensation around K_cred
	∙	Pay experienced operators for knowledge, not just hours
	∙	Make retention of high-K_cred operators a primary metric
	∙	Tie management bonuses to knowledge retention, not just cost reduction
	7.	Build knowledge transfer infrastructure
	∙	Formal apprenticeship programs
	∙	High-K_cred operators as trainers, not just line workers
	∙	Measure training effectiveness (does trainee incident rate drop faster?)

  If System Shows Solvency:
Your system is healthy. Maintain by:
	1.	Monitor leading indicators monthly
	∙	Attrition_Rate, Incident_Delta, S_recognition
	∙	Catch degradation before it becomes critical
	2.	Invest in knowledge accumulation
	∙	You have runway to build capability
	∙	Train, document, transfer knowledge while you can
	3.	Resist complexity creep
	∙	Every new layer/process/regulation: does it improve Signal_Fidelity or just add overhead?
	∙	Calculate C_index periodically, prune parasitic complexity

CRITICAL NOTES
This is Level 1: Directional only.
Accuracy: ±30% (good enough to identify which systems need deeper investigation)
You cannot:
	∙	Prove exact E_h values
	∙	Calculate precise L to three decimal places
	∙	Predict exact failure date
You can:
	∙	Identify if system is sustainable or bleeding out
	∙	Prioritize which areas need immediate attention
	∙	Decide if Level 2 audit (with actual sensors) is justified
The standard:
If this audit shows thermodynamic insolvency, assume you’re right until proven wrong by better measurement.
The cost of assuming insolvency when system is healthy: You waste money on preservation that wasn’t strictly necessary.
The cost of assuming health when system is insolvent: System collapses, knowledge lost, operators injured, catastrophic failure.
Asymmetric risk favors caution.
