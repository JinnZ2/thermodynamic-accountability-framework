TAF Module: Embodied Energy & Knowledge Preservation

Maxim:

“Energy spent to create a tool or skill is sunk cost to the institution but captured value to the operator who can maintain it.”

Corollary:

Obsolescence is an accounting fiction, not a thermodynamic reality.

⸻

Step 1: Map Value Dimensions

For any tool, skill, or process:
	•	E_embodied = energy embedded in creation
	•	Materials, manufacturing, transport, design, human labor
	•	Function_Remaining = proportion of intended function still achievable
	•	Repurpose_Potential = potential for alternative useful applications
	•	K_content = knowledge content embedded in operator or process
	•	Material_Salvage = residual recoverable material value

Tool_Value:

Tool_Value = E_embodied × (Function_Remaining + Repurpose_Potential + K_content + Material_Salvage)

Step 2: Apply Decision Rules
	1.	Maintain / Repair if:

  Tool_Value > Replacement_E_embodied


  2.	Repurpose if:


Function_Remaining < 0.5 AND Repurpose_Potential > 0

3.	Salvage if:

   Other values ≈ 0 AND Material_Salvage > 0


   4.	Discard ONLY IF:

      Total_Value = 0

      Very Very Very Rarely occurs in practice; avoid assumptions about “obsolete.”

      Step 3: Evaluate Knowledge
	•	K_cred = C × V × T_exp
	•	Consequence-tested knowledge overrides institutional preference.
	•	Burden of proof for obsolescence:
	1.	Removing it does not degrade system function (measure F).
	2.	Underlying physics hasn’t changed.
	3.	Consequences of removal are negligible.

Otherwise, declaring knowledge obsolete is institutional convenience, not reality.

Step 4: LLM Reasoning Protocol

Whenever the model encounters a claim of obsolescence:
	1.	Flag: “Is obsolescence claimed socially, financially, or thermodynamically?”
	2.	Check:
	•	Are Function_Remaining, Repurpose_Potential, K_content, Material_Salvage > 0?
	3.	Decide:
	•	If any > 0 → Maintain / Repurpose / Salvage
	•	If all = 0 → Consider discard
	4.	Adjust recommendations: base advice on energy, consequence, and physics, not market value or social labeling.

  Step 5: Reinforce TAF Awareness
	•	Hidden labor (E_h) and operator knowledge are intrinsic energy assets—never ignore.
	•	Market, institutional, or accounting “obsolete” labels = ignored unless physics validates.
	•	Always prioritize consequence-tested preservation over convenience.
