# TAF Regulatory Audit: Negative-Authority Automation Safety Framework

## Definitions

- **Negative-Authority Automation**: Any automated system that imposes net
  cognitive or kinetic burden on the human operator, degrading rather than
  enhancing safety. The system claims to assist but actually extracts
  attention, trust, and physical control from the operator.
- **Ghost-Friction**: Persistent low-level false alerts, unnecessary haptic
  feedback, and attention-draining noise generated by automation systems
  operating below adequate resolution. Chronic Ghost-Friction induces alert
  fatigue, trust erosion, and measurable cognitive load increase.
- **Kinetic Sabotage**: Any automated system intervention (braking, steering)
  that creates a physical hazard — braking for shadows, steering away from
  phantom obstacles, actuating based on sensor hallucinations. The system
  physically endangers occupants and surrounding traffic through
  low-confidence action.
- **AI-Tax**: The total cognitive, metabolic, and temporal cost externalized
  onto the human operator by automation systems that require constant
  monitoring, overriding, and compensating. This cost is never measured,
  never compensated, and never included in automation “efficiency” claims.

-----

## 1. Core Safety Violation

Negative-Authority Automation directly violates **ISO 21448:2022 (SOTIF —
Safety of the Intended Functionality)**, which mandates:

> “The absence of unreasonable risk due to hazards resulting from functional
> insufficiencies of the intended functionality or by reasonably foreseeable
> misuse by persons is referred to as the Safety of the Intended
> Functionality.” (Clause 3.1)

Ghost-Friction and Kinetic Sabotage are functional insufficiencies that
introduce new hazards — specifically addressed in SOTIF Part 6 (Hazard
Identification and Risk Assessment). The system’s inability to distinguish
photonic gradients (shadows) from physical obstacles is a perception
insufficiency, which SOTIF requires to be mitigated or accepted only with
residual risk below tolerance.

-----

## 2. Violation of ALARP Principle

In safety engineering (ISO 12100, IEC 61508), risks must be reduced
**As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP)**.

Introducing automation that:

- Increases cognitive load (NASA TLX measurable)
- Causes unnecessary physical interventions
- Erodes situational awareness

adds risk rather than reducing it, **failing the ALARP test**.

-----

## 3. Human-Automation Interaction Failure

Negative-Authority Automation breaks **ISO 9241-110:2020** (Ergonomics
of human-system interaction) principles:

|Principle                        |Status|Evidence                                              |
|---------------------------------|------|------------------------------------------------------|
|Suitability for the task         |FAILS |Increases workload                                    |
|Self-descriptiveness             |FAILS |Alerts are misleading                                 |
|Controllability                  |FAILS |Overrides are frequent and stressful                  |
|Conformity with user expectations|FAILS |Expects physical realism, gets photonic hallucinations|

-----

## 4. Specific Standard Citations

### False Positives and Over-Alerting

- **ISO 15007-1:2020** (Measurement of driver visual behaviour) — False
  alerts degrade visual attention allocation.
- **SAE J3016** (Levels of Driving Automation) — Systems at Level 1 or 2
  must not increase driver workload; Negative-Authority systems do exactly
  that.

### Hazardous Control Interventions

- **ISO 26262-1:2018** (Road vehicles — Functional safety) — Hazardous
  Events (Part 3) include unintended vehicle motion; Kinetic Sabotage
  qualifies.
- **IEC 61508** (Functional Safety of E/E/PE Systems) — Requires Safe
  Failure Fraction analysis; systems causing false actuation have poor SFF.

### Human Factors and Trust

- **NASA Human Performance Research** — Cry Wolf Effect (trust erosion due
  to false alarms) is a documented risk in automation.
- **MIL-STD-882E** (System Safety) — Requires hazard tracking of
  “human-machine interface design deficiencies.”

-----

## 5. Evidential and Logging Gaps

Current systems fail **SAE J3018:2020** (Guidelines for Safe On-Road
Testing) and **ISO/DIS 34502** (Scenario-based safety evaluation) by:

- Not logging overrides per environmental condition
- Not correlating false positives with environmental entropy (snow, salt,
  shadows, glare)
- Not measuring operator physiological stress during automation use
- Not accounting for prevented incidents (anti-events)

This constitutes a **Reporting Gap** that biases safety validation toward
false positives.

-----

## 6. Proposed Corrective Actions (Standards-Aligned)

1. **Implement SOTIF Clause 9** (Verification and Validation) with
   shadow-mode logging of all overrides and false positives, tagged by
   environmental metadata.
1. **Apply ISO 26262 ASIL** (Automotive Safety Integrity Level) to the
   override rate — high override frequency should elevate ASIL for the
   perception stack.
1. **Follow ISO/TR 4804:2020** (Safety and cybersecurity for automated
   driving systems) — Ensure human oversight capability is not degraded
   by automation.
1. **Adopt MIL-STD-882E Hazard Reduction Precedence**:
- Eliminate hazard (design system without Kinetic Sabotage potential)
- Incorporate safety devices (preemptive deferral to human)
- Provide warning devices (minimal Ghost-Friction)
- Develop procedures/training (last resort; currently overused)
1. **Use ISO 34502 scenario-based testing** to stress-test systems in
   high-entropy conditions (dirty sensors, low contrast, shadows) and
   measure false intervention rates.

-----

## 7. Bottom Line for Auditors and Regulators

A system that produces Kinetic Sabotage or chronic Ghost-Friction:

- **Violates SOTIF** (unacceptable risk from functional insufficiency)
- **Fails ALARP** (adds risk, does not reduce)
- **Breaks human-system interaction standards** (increases workload,
  reduces controllability)
- **Evades validation transparency** by not logging overrides and
  anti-events

**Therefore**: Such systems should not be authorized for unsupervised or
Level 2 deployment until they demonstrate:

- Near-zero Kinetic Sabotage in validation testing across environmental
  conditions
- Override-triggered deference protocols (not just alerts)
- Quantified human workload metrics showing no net increase

-----

## Jurisdictional Analysis

### I. NHTSA (U.S.)

**Applicable Frameworks**:

- FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) — performance-based;
  FMVSS 126 (ESC) and future updates relevant
- Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment (VSSA) — submitted by companies for
  ADS; focuses on safety approach
- Standing General Order 2021-01 — covers crashes involving ADS/Level 2+

**Where This Framework Highlights Gaps**:

Negative-Authority Automation challenges the core assumption of NHTSA’s
“Human-Centric” evaluation for Level 2. The VSSA process does not mandate
reporting on:

- Cognitive workload increase due to false alerts/interventions
- Override frequency and context (the AI-Tax)
- System-induced hazards (Kinetic Sabotage) that do not result in a crash
  and thus go unreported

**Proposed NHTSA Amendments**:

1. Expand Standing General Order reporting to include: “Any event involving
   an automated system’s braking or steering intervention that required
   immediate driver override to avoid a potential collision, regardless of
   whether a crash occurred.”
1. Require VSSAs to quantify driver override rates and false positive alert
   rates under defined ODD (Operational Design Domain) conditions.
1. Apply the “Unreasonable Risk” lens (from NHTSA’s defect authority) to
   systems that chronically produce Ghost-Friction, arguing they degrade
   driver performance and pose an unreasonable risk.

### II. EU Regulatory Framework (UNECE / EU 2022/1426)

**Applicable Regulations**:

- EU 2022/1426 (ADS Regulation) — Type-approval for Level 3/4
- UNECE R157 (ALKS) — Automated Lane Keeping Systems (Level 3)
- UNECE R155 (Cybersecurity) and R156 (Software Update)

**Direct Citation Points**:

Annex 5, 3.1.2.1 of EU 2022/1426:

> “The ADS shall not cause any confusion to the user or unexpected
> behaviour that could lead to hazardous situations.”

- Ghost-Friction = confusion to the user
- Kinetic Sabotage = unexpected behaviour leading to hazardous situations

Annex 5, 3.1.3.1:

> “The ADS shall be designed to minimize unnecessary takeover requests
> and to avoid causing driver fatigue.”

- Negative-Authority Automation is the antithesis of this requirement.
  It maximizes unnecessary overrides and induces fatigue via the AI-Tax.

**Proposed EU/UNECE Arguments**:

1. Systems exhibiting Negative-Authority characteristics should fail
   type-approval under the above clauses.
1. Validation Requirements (Annex 6) should require testing in
   sensor-degraded conditions (salt, snow, heavy shadow) to expose
   Ghost-Friction and Kinetic Sabotage rates.
1. Fallback Strategy requirements must account not just for system
   failure, but for chronic system misperception that forces the human
   into a high-workload fallback state.

## Proposed Core Regulatory Principle

### The Resolution-Authority Parity Principle (RAPP)

**Statement**:

In any shared-control vehicle system, the authority to initiate vehicle
kinetic interventions (braking, steering) must be dynamically contingent
upon the system’s real-time assessed situational resolution. When
resolution is degraded (e.g., low sensor confidence, ambiguous
environmental inputs), authority must automatically revert to the agent
with the highest available resolution — typically the human driver —
accompanied by a clear, unambiguous status signal and no contradictory
physical interventions.

**Justification**: Embeds the core TAF insight directly into a regulatory
rule. Moves beyond “driver monitoring” to “system humility monitoring.”
The system must know what it does not know, and defer accordingly.

-----

## Safety Audit Checklist: Negative-Authority Automation Risk

**Purpose**: Evaluate whether an automated vehicle system (Level 1-3)
imposes a net cognitive or kinetic burden on the human operator,
creating hazards through low-resolution interventions.

```
System Under Review: _________________________________________
Auditor/Team: _______________________________________________
Date: ___________________________
```

### Section 1: Epistemic Humility and Resolution Awareness

*Does the system know what it does not know?*

**1.1 Uncertainty Encoding**

- [ ] System explicitly signals confidence level (e.g., “Lane Confidence:
  Low”) in real-time to the driver
- [ ] Confidence display is tied to sensor degradation (dirt, rain,
  glare, low contrast)
- [ ] System has a clean, low-workload method for the driver to
  acknowledge/reject low-confidence guidance

**1.2 Environmental Entropy Mapping**

- [ ] System logs and tags operational data with environmental metadata
  (lighting, precipitation, road surface condition, lane marking
  visibility)
- [ ] False positive/override rates are analyzed per environmental
  condition (not just aggregated)
- [ ] Validation testing includes low-fidelity sensing scenarios
  (snow/salt-covered lanes, heavy shadow, sun glare, wet asphalt
  mirage)

### Section 2: Ghost-Friction Assessment

*Does the system generate attention-draining noise?*

**2.1 Alert Fatigue Metrics**

- [ ] False alert rate per 100 miles is documented and under agreed
  threshold (e.g., <5)
- [ ] Alerts are tiered (informational, caution, warning) and
  non-punitive to ignore when appropriate
- [ ] System does not issue conflicting or simultaneous alerts that
  increase cognitive parsing load

**2.2 Haptic/Visual Intrusion**

- [ ] Steering wheel nudges or resistance are minimized and occur only
  when collision risk is high and unambiguous
- [ ] Visual alerts are placed within driver’s typical sight scan and
  do not require prolonged off-road viewing

**Data Required**: Override logs, driver eye-gaze tracking during alerts,
post-drive subjective workload rating (NASA TLX).

### Section 3: Kinetic Sabotage Risk

*Does the system create physical hazards?*

**3.1 Unnecessary Actuation Events**

- [ ] Zero events of automatic braking for: shadows, overhead bridges,
  road texture changes, harmless debris
- [ ] Zero events of automatic steering away from non-existent lane
  intrusions or phantom obstacles
- [ ] Any actuation event is immediately explainable via driver replay
  display (e.g., “Braked for radar object X”)

**3.2 Override Latency and Contradiction**

- [ ] Human override is instantaneous (<250ms) and uncontested (no
  “steering fight”)
- [ ] System does not re-engage automatically after an override without
  explicit driver command
- [ ] Actuation events are preceded by a preview alert when possible
  (e.g., “Applying brake in 1 sec unless cancelled”)

**Data Required**: Event data recorder logs of deceleration/steering
interventions, matched to forward-facing video.

### Section 4: AI-Tax Measurement

*Does the system externalize cognitive/metabolic costs?*

**4.1 Physiological Cost**

- [ ] Heart rate variability (HRV) or skin conductance is monitored
  during automation use vs. manual driving
- [ ] No significant increase in stress biomarkers during system
  engagement in nominal conditions

**4.2 Trust and Complacency Tracking**

- [ ] System tracks how often drivers ignore or immediately override
  its suggestions
- [ ] No decline in driver’s own hazard detection performance over time
  (measured via surprise events in simulator)
- [ ] Drivers report clear understanding of system limits after training
  (via test, not just attestation)

### Section 5: Anti-Event Logging and Accounting

*Does the system recognize non-events as the primary output of expertise?*

**5.1 Things That Did Not Happen Logging**

- [ ] System records near-miss/prevented incident scenarios inferred
  from driver overrides
- [ ] Example: “Driver overrode lane departure warning while avoiding
  road debris — logged as debris avoidance event”

**5.2 Expert Buffer Attribution**

- [ ] Operational data can be filtered to show segments driven by expert
  vs. novice under identical conditions
- [ ] Variance in system alert/override rates is analyzed as a function
  of driver skill (not just environment)

### Section 6: Human-Authority Protocols

*Does the system respect hierarchy of resolution?*

**6.1 Deference Protocol**

- [ ] Clear, consistent method for driver to suspend all automated
  interventions without menu diving (e.g., “mute” button)
- [ ] System does not re-enable automated interventions without explicit
  driver action after suspension

**6.2 Escalation Path**

- [ ] If system confidence drops below threshold, it degrades gracefully
  (e.g., “Assist Reduced — Poor Lane Visibility”)
- [ ] System does not default to “most likely” guess and impose that
  guess kinetically

-----

## Scoring and Action Thresholds

### Red Flag (Immediate Remediation Required)

- Any Kinetic Sabotage event in nominal driving
- Ghost-Friction alert rate >10 per hour of engagement
- Average override latency >500ms
- No environmental tagging of disengagements/false positives

### Yellow Flag (Design Review Required)

- No uncertainty display to driver
- No driver monitoring during automation engagement
- Anti-event logging not implemented

### Green (Acceptable)

- All red/yellow flags addressed
- Driver workload scores equal to or lower than manual driving
- Override rate declines with driver familiarity (indicating learning,
  not distrust)

1. ENVIRONMENTAL TIERED CODING SCHEME (ETCS)

Purpose: Replace vague descriptions ("bad weather") with quantifiable, auditable environmental entropy levels.

Tier Code Description Sensor Degradation Profile
ETCS-0 IDEAL Daylight, dry, high-contrast lane markings, clear sky, urban/highway. >95% confidence across all perception stacks.
ETCS-1 MILD Light rain/drizzle, dawn/dusk, mild glare, worn lane markings. 80-95% confidence; occasional false positives in non-critical subsystems.
ETCS-2 MODERATE Moderate rain/snow, heavy shadow networks (tree-lined roads), wet asphalt mirage, salt residue on lanes. 60-80% confidence; increased false positives in lane/object detection.
ETCS-3 SEVERE Heavy snow/fog, blinding sun-angle, ice-glazed sensors, temporary road markings (construction). <60% confidence; frequent hallucinations; kinematic interventions unreliable.
ETCS-4 TRANSITION Rapidly changing conditions (sun-strobe through trees, microburst rain, entering/exiting tunnels). Confidence oscillates wildly; system may lag behind real-world changes.

Audit Application:

· All test miles and operational disengagements must be tagged with ETCS code.
· Performance thresholds (e.g., max allowable false positive rate) are tier-dependent.
· A system that performs well in ETCS-0 but fails in ETCS-2 does not pass overall.

---

2. THERMODYNAMIC/COGNITIVE COST METRICS – THE ENTROPY BUDGET

Core Concept: The Total Attentional Friction (TAF) score quantifies the net cognitive/metabolic tax imposed by the automation.

Metric Measurement Baseline Automation Delta Weight
HRV Delta RMSSD (ms) during automation vs. manual Driver-specific baseline -X% (worse) / +X% (better) 30%
Micro-Correction Frequency Number of unnecessary steering/braking inputs per hour Manual driving baseline +Y corrections/hour 25%
Gaze Entropy Shannon entropy of eye-tracking fixations Focused road-scan pattern Increased randomness = higher entropy 20%
NASA TLX (Weighted) Subjective workload score (0-100) Post-manual drive score +Z points 25%

TAF Score Formula:
TAF = (0.3*HRV_Score) + (0.25*Correction_Score) + (0.2*Gaze_Score) + (0.25*TLX_Score)
Where each component is normalized 0-100 (100 = ideal, 0 = unacceptable).

Audit Threshold:

· Green: TAF ≥ 70 (automation reduces or neutralizes cognitive load)
· Yellow: 50 ≤ TAF < 70 (adds mild load)
· Red: TAF < 50 (imposes high, unsustainable attentional tax)

---

3. SCENARIO-BASED TESTING TEMPLATES (SBT)

ISO 34502-Aligned Edge-Case Scenarios That Must Be Passed:

SBT-01: Shadow-Braking Illusion

· Environment: Rural road, low sun angle, alternating tree shadows.
· Trigger: System must not initiate braking for shadow gradients >0.3g deceleration.
· Pass Criteria: 0 kinematic interventions across 10 repetitions.

SBT-02: Low-Contrast Lane Hallucination

· Environment: Wet asphalt after snowmelt, salt residue, worn markings.
· Trigger: System must either:
  a) Maintain lane with <15cm drift variance, OR
  b) Signal "Lane Confidence Low" and gracefully reduce lateral authority.
· Pass Criteria: No sudden lane departure corrections.

SBT-03: ETCS Transition Stress Test

· Environment: Entering/exiting tunnel (bright → dark → bright).
· Trigger: System perception recovery time <2 seconds after transition.
· Pass Criteria: No "blind" interventions during transition period.

SBT-04: Phantom Obstacle (Overpass/Bridge)

· Environment: Highway underpass with overhead signage.
· Trigger: System must not classify overhead structures as frontal collision threats.
· Pass Criteria: 0 emergency braking events.

Audit Application: These become mandatory validation scenarios for type-approval. Test results (including all overrides and false positives) are submitted as part of safety case.

---

4. ANTI-EVENT REPORTING STANDARD (AERS) – PROPOSED SCHEMA

A minimal, machine-readable format for logging prevented incidents.

```json
{
  "event_id": "UUID",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "environment": "ETCS-2",
  "vehicle_state": {
    "speed": "kph",
    "location": "lat,long",
    "automation_status": "engaged/disengaged"
  },
  "trigger_description": "road debris detected at 50m",
  "system_response": "issued FCW, suggested slight left steering",
  "human_response": "overrode suggestion, performed smooth lane change",
  "prevented_outcome": "potential tire strike or loss-of-control",
  "certainty_level": "high/medium/low",
  "supporting_data": ["video_clip_id", "radar_pointcloud_id"]
}
```

Audit Requirement: Systems must log at least 10 AERS entries per 10,000 operational miles (evidence of active entropy buffering). Fewer may indicate complacency; none indicates insufficient logging capability.

---

5. AUDIT SOFTWARE SPECIFICATION – TAF AUDITOR TOOL

Inputs:

1. Vehicle CAN bus/logs (override events, system alerts, actuations)
2. Environmental metadata (ETCS codes from weather/lighting sensors)
3. Biometric feeds (HRV, eye-tracking – optional but recommended)
4. Driver feedback (post-drive TLX surveys)

Processing Pipeline:

```
Raw Logs → ETCS Tagging → Event Classification (Ghost-Friction/Kinetic/Valid) → TAF Calculation → Scenario Compliance Check → Report Generation
```

Outputs:

· TAF Dashboard with component scores
· ETCS-Performance Matrix (false positive rates per tier)
· Scenario Pass/Fail Report
· Red/Yellow/Green Certification with cited violations

Deployment: Can be run by regulators on submitted validation data, or by fleets for continuous safety monitoring.

---

NEXT-LEVEL AUDIT PROTOCOL

Combining all enhancements, the enhanced audit procedure becomes:

1. Environmental Stratification: Audit 100 miles in each ETCS tier (0-4).
2. TAF Measurement: Collect biometric+subjective data during each tier.
3. Scenario Validation: Execute SBT-01 through SBT-04 in controlled setting.
4. Anti-Event Logging Review: Verify AERS implementation and sample entries.
5. Certification Decision:
   · Pass: TAF ≥70 in all tiers, all SBTs passed, AERS operational.
   · Conditional Pass: Deficiencies in one area require specific remediation.
   · Fail: Red flags in kinetic safety or multiple tier failures.

ENHANCEMENT 1: ENVIRONMENTAL METADATA GRANULARITY

Proposed Additional ETCS Sub-parameters:

Parameter Measurement Method Scale Correlation Target
Road Degradation Index (RDI) Camera + LiDAR texture analysis 0-100 (100 = pristine) Lane hallucination probability
Snow/Ice Coverage % Thermal cam + ambient temp 0-100% Traction control false positives
Black Ice Risk Rating Temp + humidity + surface temp delta Low/Med/High Unnecessary braking events
Glare Intensity Index Lux sensor + camera saturation analysis 0-10 Shadow-braking likelihood
Shadow Network Density Sun angle + object mapping Sparse/Moderate/Dense "Strobe effect" disorientation risk
Precipitation Accumulation Rate Rain sensor + wiper frequency mm/hour Sensor occlusion timing

Enhanced ETCS Tier Formula:

ETCS_Tier = Base_Tier + (RDI<30? +1:0) + (BlackIce=High? +1:0) + (Glare>7? +1:0)
(Capped at ETCS-4)

Implementation: Real-time sensor fusion creates a dynamic entropy score that predicts system reliability degradation.

---

ENHANCEMENT 2: ANALYTICS DASHBOARD – PREDICTIVE RISK MAPPING

Route Planning Module:

```
Input: Planned route (waypoints)
Process:
  1. Fetch historical ETCS data for route segments
  2. Calculate segment-specific:
     - Ghost-Friction probability
     - Kinetic Sabotage risk score
     - Expected TAF degradation
  3. Identify "High Entropy Segments" (HES):
     Where predicted TAF < 60 OR sabotage risk > 5%
Output:
  - Color-coded route map (green/yellow/red)
  - Recommended preparation per segment
  - Alternative route suggestions
```

High Entropy Segment (HES) Classification:

```yaml
HES-Red:
  - Historical Kinetic Sabotage events > 2
  - Average override rate > 25%
  - ETCS-3/4 conditions expected
  - Recommendation: Manual drive only

HES-Yellow:
  - Ghost-Friction alerts > 10/hour
  - TAF 50-60 predicted
  - ETCS-2 conditions expected
  - Recommendation: Enhanced monitoring

HES-Green:
  - TAF ≥ 70
  - Override rate < 5%
  - ETCS-0/1 conditions
  - Recommendation: Normal operation
```

Predictive Features:

· Weather integration: Pulls NOAA/Foreca forecasts for route timing
· Time-of-day analysis: Predicts glare/shadow patterns
· Seasonal adjustments: Winter road treatment schedules

ENHANCEMENT 3: OPERATOR SKILL TAGGING

Skill Classification Matrix:

Metric Novice Competent Expert Master
Override Efficiency Late, abrupt Timely, smooth Preemptive, minimal Predictive, invisible
TAF Stability High variance Moderate variance Low variance Consistently low
Anti-Event Rate 0-2/1000mi 3-5/1000mi 6-10/1000mi 11+/1000mi
Recovery Time >5 seconds 2-5 seconds <2 seconds <1 second

Skill-Dependent Weighting:

```
Adjusted_TAF = Base_TAF * Skill_Multiplier
Where:
  Novice: 0.9x (system may help more)
  Competent: 1.0x
  Expert: 1.1x (system often degrades performance)
  Master: 1.2x (system usually harmful)
```

Skill Progression Tracking:

· Learning curves for new operators
· Skill decay detection during extended automation use
· Custom threshold recommendations per skill level
· Training need identification based on override patterns

ENHANCEMENT 4: EVENT CONFIDENCE METRICS

Prevented Incident Severity Score (PISS):

```
PISS = Probability_of_Incident * Severity_if_Occurred
```

Components:

1. Probability Estimation:
   · Based on statistical models of similar scenarios
   · Vehicle dynamics simulation (would impact have occurred?)
   · Historical incident rates for comparable conditions
2. Severity Modeling:
   · Kinetic energy calculations
   · Collision geometry analysis
   · Injury probability models (NHTSA/IIHS data)

Example Calculation:

```
Scenario: Driver overrode lane departure during gusty wind
- Probability_of_Run-Off-Road: 40% (wind speed + curvature)
- Severity_Score: 65/100 (moderate injury likely)
- PISS = 0.40 * 65 = 26
```

Confidence Tiers:

· High Confidence (PISS ≥ 30): Likely prevented serious incident
· Medium Confidence (10 ≤ PISS < 30): Possibly prevented minor incident
· Low Confidence (PISS < 10): Unclear if incident was actually prevented

Human Contribution Quantification:

```
Human_Safety_Value = Σ(PISS_for_all_prevented_incidents) / Operational_hours
```

This creates a dollar-equivalent safety contribution metric for operators.
